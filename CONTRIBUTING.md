## Issue/Feature Request
- Think about your problem and how to say it in the nicest way while still getting your point across (a.k.a social skills).

- In an `h1` tag called "Problem" (`# Problem`) list the problem you have with klarg. Make sure to be detailed, include pictures or examples if you can, and add steps on how to reproduce the problem.

- If the problem is kind of vague or seems a bit pointless, add another `h1` tag called "Why" (`# Why`), detailing why this is a problem and why it needs a solution.

- If you feel that you have some ideas on the root cause of the problem or solutions to the problem, create yet another `h1` tag called "Ideas" (`# Ideas`). You can share your ideas here.
